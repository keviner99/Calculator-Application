# Overview

The software is a command-line calculator written in C++ that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It uses variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, and functions to handle user input, perform calculations, and display results. A Calculator class organizes the programâ€™s logic, while an STL vector stores the history of calculations. The program also includes file handling to save and display past operations, demonstrating key C++ concepts in a simple and practical application.

The purpose of writing this software was to demonstrate my understanding of basic C++ programming concepts such as:

1. Variables

2. Expressions

3. Conditionals

4. Loops

5. Functions

6. Classes

7. Data structure from STL (such as a vector, list, or map)
